# About
This directory contains the code used to create the results for the Random Forests section of the report
* rf_on_CNN_predictions is used to get the Random Forests trained to predict the output of the convolutional neural network
* rf_on_raw_imdb is used to get the Random Forests trained to predict the raw sentiment of the IMDB reviews
* rf_on_layers is used to get the respective Random Forests trained to predict the output of the Convolutional Neural Network from the output of each layer
